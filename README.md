# Storage-Company---Database-APP

### Project Description:
Our project will model a storage company, where customers rent storage units from the company's warehouses. We will keep track of each unit with an ID, and also account for the type of unit, like a room or container and their capacity. Each customer can store their boxes in their unit. We will keep track of which customer owns which boxes, where these are stored, and who manages the specific unit, as well as if the customer has a plan with the warehouse company. Our warehouses have multiple locations where each unit belongs to, and is responsible for hiring employees that manage the units and keeping track of the salaries. Each employee is assigned a uniform and has carts available to use. Furthermore, we are also taking into account the parking spaces in the warehouses, and if a specific customer is using it.  


### Database specifications: 
Our database application will help the storage company to better manage warehouses, customers, the storage spaces and employees. It will maintain:
 - records for customers, the parking space that they are using and their boxes stored. 
 - records for the warehouses and their storage units and carts, as long as the boxes in each unit and parking space
 - records for the employees, uniforms they owned and their management responsibilities
It lets people check attributes like customer names and ids, boxes ownership and storing location, warehouse location and storage units that it has, storage units numbers, employee names and ids, etc. 
For example, A user can input and search a customer id and the application will tell the user which boxes that customer is storing and which unit that he/she rents. A user can also input an box id and the application can tell who owns it and where it is stored now.

### Description of the application platform: 
The platform our team has decided to use is the Computer Science departmentâ€™s Oracle DBS with Java as the language, and our front end is Java Swing
